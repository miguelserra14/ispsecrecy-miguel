/**
 * The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate that ciphertexts are vulnerable to modifications
 * and that in many cases these modifications have (painfully) predictable effect on the plaintext.
 * 
 * The setting. Teaching assistant David wants to send a highly confidential email to professor
 * Denis, most likely containing questions for the upcoming exam. Needless to say, you are very
 * interested in seeing the contents of that email. Luckily, a few things go your way.
 * 
 * First, David has no Internet connectivity, but your mobile phone does. So you kindly offer to
 * set-up a mobile hot-spot through which David will be able to connect to a FMTP server. (You get
 * to play the role of the man-in-the-middle!)
 * 
 * FMTP is a new kind of a mail protocol; it stands for Funny Mail Transfer Protocol, and it is a
 * simple text-based protocol. The first line denotes the email of the recipient, the second line
 * the email of the sender, the third line the subject of the email, then we have an empty line and
 * finally we have the email contents.
 * 
 * All that David’s mail client has to do to send an email, is to deliver a string like the
 * following to the FMTP server.
 * 
 * ```txt
 * recipient@somedomain.com
 * sender@anotherdomain.com
 * Subject line
 * 
 * <Email body>
 * ```
 * 
 * Any preceding or trailing spaces on any line are removed before processing. For instance, we
 * could have written the email above as follows and it would have made no difference.
 * 
 * ```txt
 *              recipient@somedomain.com            
 *         sender@anotherdomain.com            
 *          Subject line
 * 
 * <Email body>
 * ```
 * 
 * Third, David is naive enough to tell you that he’s sending the email to professor Denis.
 * So you know the contents of the first line of the plaintext.
 * 
 * Fourth, David is using AES in CTR mode. No integrity checks are in place.
 * 
 * The task. As the man-in-the-middle (MITM), modify the messages so that the FMTP server will not send the
 * email to professor Denis, but instead will forward the email to the address that you control. In
 * this exercise the address is `isp@gmail.com`.
 *
